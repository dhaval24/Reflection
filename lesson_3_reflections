When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local?

    Ans. Whenever there are more than one contributors to a project I would like to create a remote
    repository so that everyone can work collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Ans. I would like to pull the changes manually rather than having Git automatically pulling it as it would allow me with much more
    flexibility to incorporate changes which may sometimes cause bug to my version of code.
