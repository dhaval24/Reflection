What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    Ans When you initlialize the git repository git makes a .git directory in the directory
    which contains the configuration file. Initally git makes no commit and you are on the
    master branch.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
    Ans Staging area is a buffer area which is temporaryily used to hold the files which are ready to be commited
    and allows user to cross verify it before performing the final commit. The changes made in the staging area 
    can easily be reverted without any problem.
