When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local?

    Ans. Whenever there are more than one contributors to a project I would like to create a remote
    repository so that everyone can work collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Ans. I would like to pull the changes manually rather than having Git automatically pulling it as it would allow me with much more
    flexibility to incorporate changes which may sometimes cause bug to my version of code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    
    Ans. Fork is used to make a clone of some one else public repository in your github. Remember fork is used in context of github not
    git and it automatically creates a remote. 
    Clone is used when you want to clone a local or remote repository to your local machine. It copies entire commit history
    Branches are used inside the git repository to enhance parallel developement in a collaborative way. It is particularly useful
    to create a branch when you want to experiment on new feature, perform developement on a seperate module etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    
    Ans. This helps in merging two branches using git pull or git merge to attain a consistant state.
