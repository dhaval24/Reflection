How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could easily find out the lines which were different and that helped me.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can get back any changes which I made to a previous version in case the 
    changes are not effective

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Flexibility to have a checkpoint at our own pace.
    Cons: May loose progress if in case of failure before commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Provides much more flexibility. It allows us to keep a track of changes made in some files which
    might affect others too.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log command can help us view all the commits with the files which got affected in that commit. git diff can be 
    used to see the difference in the files in 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can easily recover the past version from history and hence we are more free of tension

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try to do collaborative file sharing and updates.
